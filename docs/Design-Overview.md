### Sub-systems
1) Frontend: React serves the user interface screens to the end user. The static resources needed are handled by the React static server. React also handles routing between different pages for client input and displays plan output. 
2) Middle-tier: Django REST Framework exposes the API endpoints that are consumed by React
3) Backend: The backend is built with Django. A model class is the single, definitive source of information about the data. It contains the essential fields and behaviors of the data youâ€™re storing. Generally, each model maps to a single database table so a model can retrieve and store data in the database.
4) Database: Client, advisor, and plan information is stored in a PostgreSQL database. The database layer is accessible via Django models and subsequently handed over to the middle tier using the Django REST framework.
